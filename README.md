This project is a Python-based solver for the classic puzzle game Sokoban. Using search algorithms like BFS (Breadth-First Search), DFS (Depth-First Search), and A* with customizable heuristics, the solver can automatically find solutions for Sokoban levels. It's designed for both educational purposes and as a foundation for more advanced AI problem-solving techniques in puzzle games.
